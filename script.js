/* If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity

// prints "hi" in the browser's dev tools console
// console.log("Script Running");

// Select the input element using its id, and store that in a variable called textbox
// const textbox = document.querySelector("#userInput");

// Log that element to the console just to confirm the query selector worked.
// console.log(textbox);

// textbox and #userInput refer to the same thing. The code in this file
// refers to that html element as textbox from now on.

// Challenge: There is one other element in the html that this file will l
// need to refer to. What is it?


// Now we want an event listener to listen to an event (e) to wait for
/* 
DOM_Node_to_listen_on.addEventListener("EVENT_TO_LISTEN_FOR", (e)=> {
    WHAT_TO_DO_WHEN_IT_HAPPENS.
})
*/

// Try "input" and "change" for the event type and decide which you prefer

// Check the value property of textbox. This variable is textbox.value

  // Now we can test to see IF have a certain value

  // IF there is another value wgucg us cirrect (else if), we could say something else

    // and if it is wrong (else), we could say...



// Inside of the if Add to the innerHTML property of the pictureBox

// Look at pictureBox.innerTHML in the console.

// Now add to pictureBox.innerHTML You should use BACKTICS `` (top left of keyboard with ~)

// Use tags like >h3? in the innerHTML and see what happens

// Now add <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/01b27d37-a07e-4e2e-8caf-659256274937%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-08-08%20at%208.39.11%20AM.png?v=1565269664594"/>
